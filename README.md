# Productivity Tracker
This is a simple web app for keeping track of time spent on the various tasks that compose ones life. The thinking here is that if we are able to keep a complete record of where we spend our time on a daily and weekly basis, we'll be able to better identify the areas of our lives that we spend too much and too little time on and make changes to adjust accordingly. Benefits I anticipate seeing (fingers crossed) after extended use of this app include productivity increases in areas  (as I race to speed up tasks that I realize I spend to much time on) and more time spent doing the things I enjoy (as I map out the scope of the difference between the amount of time I want to spend doing those things and the amount of time I actually spend doing those things). Data is stored locally on your browser and you have the ability to backup/reset your data as you please. Works great on mobile; since our phones are always with us, mobile is the best way to use this app. Enjoy!
